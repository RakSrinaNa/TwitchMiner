You'll have to provide a valid SpringBoot configuration.
In the examples of setup above it is under yml format but can be anything spring accepts.

Especially you'll need to provide a database connection.

Here's an example for MariaDB:

[source,yml]
----
spring:
  datasource:
    url: "jdbc:mariadb://127.0.0.1:3306/ChannelPointsMiner"
    username: "user"
    password: "pass"
  jpa:
    generate-ddl: false
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: none
      naming:
        implicit-strategy: org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.ImplicitNamingStrategyLegacyJpaImpl
        physical-strategy: org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.PhysicalNamingStrategyStandardImpl
