= Discord settings

Discord settings can be customized to filter events and/or customize the format of messages sent.

== Filtering [[filtering]]

To filter messages, you need to provide a list of events you want to be sent, and set no customization.

The name of the events can be found in link:https://github.com/Rakambda/ChannelPointsMiner/tree/develop/miner/src/main/java/fr/rakambda/channelpointsminer/miner/event/impl[miner/src/main/java/fr/rakambda/channelpointsminer/miner/event/impl] as the name of the classes (name of the file without `.java`).

.Example to sent only 3 type of events with default format
[%collapsible]
====
[source,json]
----
include::example$discord-filtering.json[]

== Format

Format works the same way as <<filtering, filtering>> except that additional parameters are provided.

Placeholders are expected to be between braces, example: `\{placeholder_name}`.
Available values can be seen in link:https://github.com/Rakambda/ChannelPointsMiner/blob/develop/miner/src/main/java/fr/rakambda/channelpointsminer/miner/event/EventVariableKey.java[EventVariableKey].

NOTE: If you want to override the format of one event, you'll have to do the all as it'll also act as a filter.

.Example of filtering 2 events with 1 having a custom format
