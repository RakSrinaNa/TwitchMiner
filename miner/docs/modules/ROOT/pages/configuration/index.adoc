= Configuration

Configuration is split into several parts.
First a global configuration that'll define the accounts to use for mining as well as default settings for each channel mined.
Then each mined channel can override the default settings.

== Streamers to mine

You have two options to load streamers in the mining list:

* Be specific and define streamer settings for each streamer you want to watch.
For this simply add a JSON file withing one of the streamer config directories with the name of the streamer (eg: `my_streamer.json`).
The content of the file will override the default streamer settings for the keys that are redefined.
If you want to use the default streamer settings simply use an empty file or put an empty JSON object in the file (ie: `{}`).
* Load them from the follows list.
Every follow will be loaded and default settings will be applied to them.

== JSON Schema

Schema provide descriptions for all fields.
You can also validate your configuration with the provided schemas (there's some online tools like link:https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net[]).
