= Logger

You can define yourself how the logs looks like by supplying your own link:https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html[Log4j2 configuration file].

Some examples are provided in the `src/examples/loggers` folder.

When you configure your link:https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/layouts.html[patterns] you'll of course have access to all the default fields possible like the date, message, etc.
In addition to that the context will be populated with some keys depending on the available data (in the case of the Pattern layout, see `%X`).
These keys are listed below:
