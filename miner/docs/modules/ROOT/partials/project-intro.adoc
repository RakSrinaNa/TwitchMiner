The main objective of this miner is to acquire Twitch channel points automatically.
Other forms of point, like those provided by bots through IRC (Streamlabs, etc.), isn't in the scope of the miner.

* Watch streams for you, earning the baseline points as you watch.
* Get the watch streak points by watching streams regularly.
* Claim bonus points when they are available.
* Follow raids.
* Participate and claim link:https://www.twitch.tv/drops/campaigns[campaigns].
* Join IRC chat.
* Participate in predictions and record peoples predictions.
* Claim link:https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/moments[moments].

Limits:

* Twitch makes it so that only 2 streamers can be watched at once.
However, actions that are not watching are not limited.
This includes raids and predictions.

This project heavily inspired by link:https://github.com/Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2[Tkd-Alex/Twitch-Channel-Points-Miner-v2,window="_blank"], just doing it my own way.
