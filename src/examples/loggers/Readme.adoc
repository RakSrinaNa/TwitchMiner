== rolling_file.xml

* Log into a file that is archived if conditions are met.
* Logs are logged into `./logs/miner.log` and then archived to `./logs/miner.log.2021-07-26.gz`.
* One file represents a day.
* Only the last 10 logs will be kept.
* Logs from `fr.rakambda.channelpointsminer.miner` will only be logged if the level is INFO or higher.
* All the other logs are logged if they have WARN level or higher.

Format of the logs is the same as <<console_only,console_only.xml>>.
